# Wi-Fi-Access-Point

Our project group has received an assignment to make a Wi-Fi access point with the use of a Raspberry Pi.
The client gave the project group 9 weeks to build a working project.
The requirements of the Wi-Fi access point are
* Can host a Wi-Fi SSID.
* Can connect to an existing SSID.
* Can manage a Black- and Whitelist.
* Can search for the best signal.
